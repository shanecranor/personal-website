<h3>Shane at 42 to 43  months</h3>

<p>The weather has been pretty warm this fall, although there have
been a few cold days. Shane is glad that he can still go out and play
a lot and it's not too cold when he walks to school. It stayed warm
long enough for the stone cleaners to finish <a href =
"http://lorrie.cranor.org/photos/house-clean.html">cleaning</a> the
outside of Shane's house, but the chimneys will have to wait until
Spring. Shane likes to help clean inside the house. He especially
likes to help vacuum the kitchen.</p>

<p>Grandma Connie and Papa Morris came to visit for Thanksgiving. We
went to some fun places with them like the Carnegie Museum and the
playground.</p>

<p>The season of winter holidays and holiday parties has begun. Shane
got to go to Mom's poster fair and then to the INI holiday party. He
also attended several other CMU holiday parties. Great Grandma Gertie
and Great Grandpa Harry came to visit with Grandma Judy and Papa Mike
during Hanukkah. Shane got to try out his new snow shovel during our
brief blast of winter. Then we went to Maryland. Shane had a great
time with Cousin Justin and he got to ride the Metro. Somehow we got
everyone to look at the camera at the same time for a big family
portrait, although the photographer tried to cut off the top of Uncle
Jeff's head. Shane managed to get a big cut on his face after he and
Justin wacked each other with books, but Mom managed to camouflage it
so you can't see it in the family portrait. When we came back to
Pittsburgh the snow was gone and the weather was warm again so we
played outside a lot. Shane put together his new tool bench and showed
Maya how to use his tools. Vacation has been fun, but Shane can't wait
to go back to school.</p>

<p>Shane and Maya helped Mom and Dad make a chocolate souffle cake for New Year's Eve. After Shane ate his cake he went night night.</p>
