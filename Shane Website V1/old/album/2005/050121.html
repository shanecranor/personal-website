<h3>Shane at 44 to 49 months</h3>

<p>Shane and Maya have been having a good time riding around on Maya's
new Bobby car. Some of their other toys have been put away so they
don't get dusty during our great house rewiring project. Shane got
lots of holes in the walls and ceiling of his room and a new light
fixture. Shane made lots of valentines for his friends and relatives.</p>

<p>Shane had a good time at Harrison's birthday party at the
Children's Museum. The water room was an especially big hit. Shane
also enjoyed making a print in the art room.</p>

<p>Maya likes to wear her backpack around the house, especially when
Shane has his backpack on too. Sometimes when Shane is really tired he
takes a long nap. Maya thinks it is fun to crawl into bed with him and
wake him up.</p>

<p>Shane likes the party hat and sunglasses he got at Katheryne's
birthday party. He likes to wear them when he eats ravioli -- one of
his favorite foods to have for lunch. Shane had a good time when his
grandparents and great grandparents came for a visit.</p>

<p>Shane had a great time at the CMU Carnival. He was especially
looking forward to riding the purple ride. He remembered riding it
last year, but this year he wanted to sit in the driver's seat. A
little girl beat him to it, but she was willing to share.</p>

<p>Shane likes the flowers that are growing in our garden. He is
learning the names of some of the flowers he sees on the way to
school: tulips, daffodils, and hyacinths. He thinks we should plant
more tulips in the fall. He is jealous of Maya's poncho -- he wants
one too!</p> <p>

<p>Mom and Dad came to Shane's school on his birthday and brought the
banana muffins. Mom read <i>Green Eggs and Ham</i> to the class. The
Smith's came over for dinner and had pizza and birthday cake. Shane
enjoyed unwrapping his presents.</p>

<p>Shane likes to look at all the flowers growing in our garden. He
knows the names of some of the flowers now. He thinks we should plant
tulips in more colors next fall.</p>

<p>Shane had a good time at Jack's birthday party, but it was very hot outside. Shane got a very loud horn at Jack's party. Mom and Dad will only let him play it outside.</p>
