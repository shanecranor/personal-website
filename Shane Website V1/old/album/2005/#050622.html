<p>Shane took some swimming lessons at the Schenley Park pool. He also
  had a good time wearing his bathing suit while playing in the
  driveway.</p>

<p>Shane went to the Carnegie museum. He has been busy tending the
  garden. We planted tomatos and pumpkins and lots of coleus cuttings
  (all taken from Shane's little plant that he got at Phipps last
  year).</p>

<p>Maya and Shane stayed with Grandma Connie and Papa Morris while Mom
  and Dad went to Edinburgh. They had a great time playing in the
  wading pool, going to the playground, and spending a day at Dutch
  Wonderland.</p>

<p>Maya and Shane went to Cousin Justin's 4th birthday party on their
  way back home to Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>Shane and Maya really like to drink milk. Right before we left
  for vacation we had the outside of our house painted. Shane thinks
  the front entrance looks pretty spiffy now with its "orange"
  trim. Maya and Shane like to play in Mom's sewing room. Mom lets
  them use her scraps to design quilts on the wall and the floor.</p>
