<p>Shane said goodbye to some friends and helped pack up his things
  to move to Pittsburgh. The boxes were fun to climb on and the paper
  and tape were lots of fun too. Shane liked the "box man" and his
  big truck.</p>

<p>This year all the grandparents came to visit Maya and Shane for
  the winter holidays. Maya and Shane got lots of nice
  presents. Shane stayed up late almost every night. But Shane was
  too tired to stay up until midnight on New Year's Eve. Shane
  celebrated on New Year's Day by making a peanut butter
  sandwich. "No jelly!" he says. </p>

<p>Shane likes to play with his Thomas choo choo in the play
  room. Sometimes he gives Maya horsey back rides. Shane went to
  Phipps garden to see the garden choo choos and lots of plants and
  trees. He learned how to take a cutting from a coleus plant and
  plant it so that it will grow roots. Shane took his "little plant"
  home and put it on the kitchen window sill.</p>
