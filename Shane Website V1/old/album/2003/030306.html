<h3>22-23 Months</h3>


<p>When Shane goes night night he likes to make sure he has his
  doggies and his quilt and his blanket and lots of toys. Sometimes
  he talks and sings to himself for a while before he goes to
  sleep. When he wakes up in the morning he talks and sings some more
  until Mom and Dad finally wake up and take him out of his
  crib. Sometimes he takes his PJs off if he gets bored, but he
  doesn't know how to put them back on so then he gets cold. Shane
  has had lots of visitors recently -- grandparents and great
  grandparents visiting every weekend. Shane is happy that the snow
  has melted and he can go outside wearing a sweater rather than a
  heavy coat. The deer are happy too because they can eat the grass
  in Shane's backyard now (as Shane points out to Grandma
  Connie). Shane has become quite articulate about what he wants and
  doesn't want. He negotiates with Mom and Dad about what he wants to
  eat and wear. If Mom suggests a shirt to wear in the morning Shane
  often says, "How about the yellow choo choo shirt?" If Mom tells him
  that shirt is dirty he says, "Wash it!" If Dad asks him if he wants
  to eat some apple sauce, Shane says very emphatically, "I don't
  want to eat the apple sauce!"

Dad painted the old office blue for Shane. Mom and dad brought the
bed upstairs that they painted blue last summer and put it in Shane's
new blue room. The bed still needs some new sheets and the room needs
some more furniture, but Shane is looking forward to sleeping in his
new big boy bed soon.

<p>Shane likes to go outside and play in the dirt. He likes to pick
  up rocks and dig with sticks. Fort Nonsense is fun because there
  are lots of rocks there and a big cannon too. Shane's new favorite
  expression is "I don't want to X anymore." Where X might be "go
  night night," "get dressed," "eat toast" or whatever it is he is
  currently being asked to do. Shane has started attending gym class
  on Saturday mornings. He likes to play with the balls and climb on
  the mats there. He is learning how to walk on the balance
  beam. Shane can now climb into his car seat by himself.</p>

<p>Shane's friend Mira came over to play. Shane and Mira like to
  bounce on Shane's blue bed. Shane likes to say "I just want to X"
  where X might be "go up mama," or "read the truffula tree book," or
  "go in the silver car" or what ever it is he wants. Often he
  changes his mind, however, and "just" wants to do something else.</p>
