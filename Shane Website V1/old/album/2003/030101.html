<h3>20-21 Months</h3>

<p>Shane started the new year by going night night at 7:30 pm and
  missing the ball drop. He was very excited later that week when
  Mom got her new Powerbook G4 laptop. "Apple 'puter light on!" he
  says as he points to the glowing apple icon on the lid. Shane likes
  to watch slide shows on the computer. He recognizes most of his
  relatives and their respective pets, as well as some of the animals
  he saw at the zoo. "I want picture Uncle Jere," he says. He is also
  learning the letters of the alphabet. He likes to pick them out on
  the computer keyboard and to look at the big letters Mom shows him
  on the screen.</p>

<p>The basement construction is almost done. Mom and Dad have been
  busy painting -- they have gone through many gallons of "vanilla
		icecream" paint.. Shane likes to go down to the basement to inspect
  their work. He also likes to help sweep the floor. "Cleaning the
  letter O," says Shane. This weekend Shane played with Mom and Dad's
  friend Brian when he came for a visit. Shane also had a breakfast
  date with his friend Mira. Shane checked out the new Walmart that
  opened this week and Mom bought him his very own Elmo.</p>

<p>Mom and Dad bought Shane a big boy chair at Ikea. Shane likes it
  much better than his highchair. He likes to sit in his chair and
  eat his breakfast. We have gotten lots of snow this winter. Shane
  doesn't really like going outside in the cold, but he let Mom take
  him on the sled in the backyard. Shane couldn't believe how much
  snow we got during the blizzard. He could only walk along the path
  that Mom and Dad cleared. Shane thinks it is more fun to stay
  inside where it is warm. He really likes playing in the newly
  finished basement.</p>

<p>Shane likes to talk a lot. Sometimes he finds himself very
  funny. He likes to sit on the steps with Mama and eat a snack.
