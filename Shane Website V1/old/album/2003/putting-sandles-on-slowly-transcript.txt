movie: Shane putting his sandals on, Aug 18 19:40 2003
------------------------------------------------------

cast:
    Shane: outside on deck, in chair, with sandals
    Lorrie: with camera, filming Shane
    Chuck (aka Dada): in background, preparing to mow lawn.


	[Shane starts to put his sandals on...]

Shane: I'm doing it by myself.

Lorrie [from off screen]: Can you put them on tight?

Shane: No, slowly.

	[Note that Shane says "slowly" rather than "loose"...]

Lorrie: How about tight?

Shane: Eh, slowly.   I'm putting them on slowly.

	[Shane sees Chuck with his lawn mower ear plugs on]

	Dada's got his ear plugs on.
	I have my other shoe on.
	I'm putting my other shoe back on.
	I'm putting my other shoe on.

	[Shane realizes that ear plugs means the lawn tractor will be
	 coming out really soon now.  This is exciting stuff!]

	Oh, Dada's got his ear plugs on!
	That's the ear plugs on.
	I like ear plugs.

	Oh, oh, oh, I want to mow my lawn too!
	I don't have a lawn mower.
	I have my lawn mower...
	I did have my lawn mower in my garage.

	[Shane has been pretending that his orange Home Depot car (currently
	 in the garage) is a lawn mower.  He re-focuses on finishing putting
	 on his sandals.]

	Slowly.
	It's slowly.
	What I'm doing?
	I'm putting my sandals on, very slowly.

	[Shane often likes to ask himself "What am I doing?" or 
	 "What am I doing here?"]

	[Shane mumbles to himself as he finishes (successfully) putting
	 his sandals on!]

THE END
