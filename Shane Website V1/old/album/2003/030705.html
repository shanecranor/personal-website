<h3>26-27 Months</h3>

<p>Shane went to Hopkinsville, Kentucky with Mom and Dad. He likes to
  ride the monorail choo choo at Newark airport and help with the
  suitcases. He is especially concerned about the big black suitcase
  because he knows that Tyler doggie travels in there. Shane had lots
  of cousins to play with in Kentucky. Aunt Ginny and Uncle Jeff took
  Shane swimming in the hotel pool. Shane says he likes to go "this
  way and that way." Sometimes he likes to pretend he is the hungry
  caterpillar.

Shane now sleeps in his blue big boy bed. He has a new chest of
drawers and lamps for his blue room too. Grandma Connie sent Shane
some of the clothes that Dad wore when he was two. Shane tried them
on, but he doesn't think they are very comfortable to play in.

<p>Shane went to Maryland to visit Grandma Judy and Grandpa Mike. He
  went to Grandma Judy's office and saw the geese and the
  dinosaur. On Saturday he went to Justin's second birthday party. On
  Sunday lots of relatives came over for Aunt Nancy's birthday. Alex
  and Mark showed Shane how to paint with water colors. Shane tried
  on some of Grandma Gladys' jewelry. Amy read Shane a book. Later
  Shane went to Cabin John Park to ride the train. On Monday Shane
  went to Justin's house again and played with Justin's new toys.

<p>Shane likes to help Dad take out the garbage. He also likes to
  watch Dad mow the lawn with his big tractor. Shane pretends his
  orange car is a tractor. After mowing the lawn, everyone needs to
  take a bath. Shane likes to eat vanilla yogurt for
  breakfast. Sometimes he eats lemon yogurt too. But he doesn't like
  any yogurt that has "crumbs" in it. Shane likes to get mail --
  especially presents in the mail. Grandma Connie sent him some new
  PJs but its too hot to wear them right now.
