<h3>28-29 Months</h3>

<p>Labor Day weekend was lots of fun. Grandma Connie and Grandpa
  Morris stopped by for a visit. The big hole in our front yard got
  filled in with lots of dirt (a process involving dump trucks and
  backhoes). And Shane went to a party and got to splash in a very
  big puddle.</p>

<p>Shane got to meet his baby sister <a href =
					"http://lorrie.cranor.org/maya/">Maya</a>. Shane checked her
  feet to see if she was wearing any shoes. No shoes, but Shane found
  big toes and little toes!

<p>Shane was very excited when Maya and Mom came home from the
  hospital. With all his grandparents there too he was really
  bouncing off the walls. He helped Dad and Grandpa Morris clean up
  the big tree branch that fell in our backyard during Hurricane Isabel.</p>

<p>Shane is curious about Maya but doesn't want to get too close. Mom
  signed him up for lots of classes to help get some of the ants out
  of his pants. He goes to gym class, yoga class, music class, and
  story time at the library. Shane's friend Mira has a new baby
  brother named Nathan who is one week younger than Maya. Shane went
  to the playground with Mira after Nathan's bris.</p>
