<p>Shane had lots of guests for his second birthday. Grandma Judy and
  Grandpa Mike came the day before and brought Shane a climber with a
  slide. Grandma Connie, Grampa Morris, Aunt Ginny, Uncle Jeff,
  Justin, Great Granma Gertie, and Great Grandpa Harry came for
  Shane's party. Shane had an ice cream cake and opened lots of
  presents.</p>

<p>Shane likes to sing lots of songs. He especially likes to sing
  when he is supposed to be going night night. The ABC song, the itsy
  bitsy spider song, and Old MacDonald are among his favorites. Shane
  went on an airplane with Mom and Dad and flew to Pittsburgh. Shane
  liked Pittsburgh because they have lots of bridges and choo
  choos. He especially liked riding the incline.</p>

Shane likes to go to Panera with Mom and Dad on Saturday
mornings after gym class. Sometimes he eats a plain bagel and drinks a "moo cow
milk." Wherever he goes, Shane likes to bring his Bob the Builder
backpack, loaded up with a few crayons, his school bus, his mini van,
some snacks, and a few necessities. When we went to Pittsburgh we
accidently left the mini van and school bus in the rental car and we
had to call up Hertz and get them to FedEx them back to us.
