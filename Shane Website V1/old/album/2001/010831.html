<h3>Shane's Eighteenth Week</h3>

<p>Labor Day Weekend: Shane got a swing last week -- now he has a place to sit
at the kitchen table. Shane went with Mom and Dad to Panera for
lunch and dad got an ice tea in this big cup. Shane was impressed that
Dad could finish off three of these! Shane tried on the sweater Great
Grandma Gertie knit for him, but it's still too hot for
sweaters. On Monday Shane had lunch with Mira and her parents.</p>

<h3>Shane's Nineteenth Week</h3>
<p>
Shane went with Mom and Dad to Grandma Gertie and Grandpa Harry's house on
Saturday. Grandma babysat while Mom and Dad went to a wedding. On
Sunday Grandma Connie and Grandpa Morris and Great Grandma Ginnie came
to visit. Shane has gotten very good at rolling over and he likes to
spend time on his tummy looking around. He's also into blowing bubbles
and saying "Bbbbbb."

<p>On September 11 Mom flew to Washington, DC. After the terrorist
attacks, she couldn't fly home or even take the train. So Grandma Judy
and Grandpa Mike drove her to Deleware. Dad and Shane and Yvonned met
Mom at Grandma Connie and Granpa Morris' house.</p>

<h3>Shane's Twentieth Week</h3>
<p>The weather is getting cooler, so Shane wears a hat when he goes
for his evening walk. Mom got a new sling that's very colorful. Shane
is learning how to sit, but he still needs some help to keep from
toppeling over.</p>
