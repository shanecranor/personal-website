<h3>Shane's Twenty-first Week</h3>

<p>Shane didn't get to go to Paris, so as a conciliation prize he got
to go to work with mom and dad and spend some time with Grandma
Connie.</p>

<h3>Shane's Twenty-second Week</h3>

<p>Shane likes to grab his toys and put them in his mouth. He has a
yellow triangle and a green ring that he especially likes. And after a
hard day he likes to sleep in his club house under the desk in the
study. This week he also got to go to Cleveland with Mom to attend the
Privacy 2001 conference. The conference was much more interesting than
staying at home. And Shane even got to go to the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame and he met the chairman of the FTC.</p>

<h3>Shane's Twenty-third Week</h3>

<p>After he got back from Cleveland, Shane complained that sitting
around at home was too boring. So Mom and Dad decided to feed him his
first solid food. Shane tried some rice cereal and gave it mixed
reviews.</p>

<h3>Shane's Twenty-fourth Week</h3>
<p>This week Shane took NJ Transit to New York with Mom when she gave
a lecture at NYU. Shane enjoyed the train ride, and he also liked
going out to dinner with the professors after Mom's lecture. (Sorry,
Mom didn't take any pictures.) Shane is now eating rice cereal and
oatmeal. He is also getting pretty good at rolling and inching around
on his belly. He especially likes to play on the colorful quilt Mom
made for him. He also likes to ride on Dad's shoulders and bang on his
high chair. This week Shane took his first bath in a real bath tub.</p>
