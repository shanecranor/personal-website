<h3>Shane's Twenty-eighth Week</h3>

<p>Shane flew to Denver with mom and dad. They travelled to Keystone
with Grandma Connie and Grandpa Morris. Shane is starting to
babble. In addition, to "eh," he now says "ah" and "bah" and "ah-bah."
And when he's mad he says "um" and "ma." And when he's happy he likes
to giggle and shriek.

<h3>Shane's Twenty-ninth Week</h3>
<p>Shane enjoyed going out to dinner with everyone, and especially
sitting in the high chair. He saw the continental divide at the
Loveland Pass and Buffalo
Bill's grave in Golden. On Thanksgiving Shane went to Pennsylvania to
visit (Great) Aunt Bonnie and Uncle Fred. He saw Great Grandma Gertie
and Great Grandpa Harry there too. And he met Shayna the dog. Shane
was happy to meet Shayna, but Shayna wanted to run away.

<p>After Thanksgiving, Shane got to meet Gopal, who was visiting
from California.</p>

<h3>Shane's Thirty-first Week</h3> <p>Shane likes to eat lots of
fruits and vegetables. He especially likes the sweet fruits. He is
developing a sweet tooth, but he doesn't have any teetch yet. Mommy
made Shane some homemade sweet potatoes.  Shane made quite a mess when
he ate them, so he took a bath in the sink to clean up (the third sink
photo was featured on our holiday cards). Shane has become quite a
good crawler. He can now climb the two steps up from the family room
into the kitchen and also pull himself up to a standing position when
he holds onto something, but he still falls down a lot because his
balance isn't very good. This week Shane visited with cousin Neil and
Jacqueline.</p>

<h3>Shane's Thirty-second Week</h3>
<p>Shane likes to play with Dad's laptop computer. He also likes to
find all the ethernet cables in the house. Peas are his favorite green
vegetable -- much better than green beans! Shane celebrated his first 
Hanukah. He really liked the candles and the pretty ribbons on all the
packages.
