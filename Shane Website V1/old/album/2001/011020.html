<h3>Shane's Twenty-fifth Week</h3>

<p>Shane went to visit Grandma Connie and Grandpa Morris in Deleware
while Mom and Dad went to a wedding. Grandma bought Shane a warm suit
for the winter.  Shane is very interested in
drinking from Dad's glass -- but sometimes he spits up in it.

<h3>Shane's Twenty-sixth Week</h3>
<p>
This was a busy week for Shane. On Saturday he took the Amtrak train
to Washington, DC with Mom and Dad to attend the TPRC2001 conference
that Mom was chairing. Grandma Judy and Grandpa Mike came to the
conference hotel to see Shane. Shane tried on his Halloween costume a
few days early and sat in the hotel restaurant's fall display. He got
to wear his costume again on Halloween. He visited the Kerrs to show
off his costume. On Thursday Mom invited her department over for lunch
to celebrate Omer's wedding. Shane got to meet Mom's colleagues and
Bill's kids.

<h3>Shane's Twenty-seventh Week</h3>

<p>Shane is starting to "crawl" around more. It's still more a wiggle
than a proper crawl. This week he experienced a brief power outage and
got to watch mom and dad rake lots of leaves.
