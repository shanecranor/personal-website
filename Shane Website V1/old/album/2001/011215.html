<h3>Shane's Thirty-third Week</h3>

<p>Shane likes to go to Panera with Mom and Dad -- Panera is just like
  the St. Louis Bread Company, which Mom and Dad used to go to all the
  time when they lived in St. Louis. </p>

<h3>Shane's Thirty-fourth Week</h3>

  <p>Shane had an exciting winter vacation. Before leaving town with Mom
  and Dad he got a visit from Mira and Anna. Then he went to Maryland
  (by way of Deleware) and visited Grandma Judy and Grandpa Mike. Uncle
  Jeremy and Auntie Amber were there too, along with Jal the dog. The
  whole gang (except Jal) wrapped presents on Christmas Eve to raise
  money for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. Shane enjoyed playing with
  the ribbons until he fell asleep. Then everyone went out for Chinese
  food afterwards. On Christmas Day Shane went to Aunt
  Ginny and Uncle Jeff and Cousin Justin's house. Shane got to meet
  Tyler the dog. Grandma Connie and Grandpa Morris were there too. There
  were lots of presents for everyone -- so many that Shane fell asleep
  before they were all unwrapped.

<h3>Shane's Thirty-fifth Week</h3>

  <p>After Shane got back from Maryland it was a little boring because
  there weren't so many people around to play with. But fortunatly he
  has lots of toys to play with. And Shane was busy working on his
  climbing skills too. Then two days later all of Shane's
  grandparents and Amber and Jeremy and Jal came to visit him. 
  Then there was New Year's Eve and Shane got to stay up late and
  watch the ball drop on TV. The next day a whole bunch of Mom and
  Dad's friends from grad school came to visit -- Milind, Zubin,
  Christos, Diana, and Apostolos. </p>
