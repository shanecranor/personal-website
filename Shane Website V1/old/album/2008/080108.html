<h3>Shane at age 6 - 2008</h3>

<p>Mom got a fancy new camera and took lots of pictures of
everyone. Shane lost two teeth. Shane has been having a good time
playing Fritz and Chester on his computer. He has joined the chess
club at school too.</p>

<p>Shane is growing an amaryllis plant and measuring it every day for
his science project. We have had a lot of snow in February, and Shane
