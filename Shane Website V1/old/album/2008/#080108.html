<p>Mom got a fancy new camera and took lots of pictures of
everyone. Shane lost two teeth. Shane has been having a good time
playing Fritz and Chester on his computer. He has joined the chess
club at school too.</p>

<p>Shane was excited to open his birthday presents. He got lots of new
furniture for his room, including his very own "tuffet." He likes to
sit on his tuffet with his "thinking cap" on and read. Grandma Connie
and Papa Morris came to visit Shane for his birthday. They brought him
a giant K'Nex roller coaster. Shane also got a new bike with "six gears."</p>

<p>We went to the zoo so Shane could see a real live orangutan since
he was writing a report on orangutans. Shane kept turning his head so
his stitches wouldn't show up in mom's photos. (Shane got seven stitches on the
eyebrow after colliding with a stone wall on his bike).</p>
