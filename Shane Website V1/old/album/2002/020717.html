<p>Bath time is lots of fun. After his bath Shane puts on his PJs and
looks for his Maisy book under mom's pillow. He likes to have his
doggy with him too when he gets ready to go night night.</p>

Shane's grandparents like to visit him often, which is just fine with
Shane. They bring him lots of toys, which he likes to spread out all
over the house. Shane recently discovered that it is interesting to
look at the world upside down. Riding in the pack is fun, and helps
keep Shane out of trouble when Mom and Dad are working on something
they don't want Shane to get into. Shane likes to help with
everything, especially if he can make a mess. Watering mom's plants is
fun because you can stick your hand in the muddy dirt. The tomoatoes
look like balls, so Shane has to be reminded not to pick them before
they are ready. Shane learned how to say pack, toes, yogurt, vitamins,
rice, cup, and bowl. Rice is one of his favorite foods -- especially 
mexican rice.

Shane went to Deleware with Mom and Dad to help Grandpa Morris
celebrate his birthday. Aunt Ginny, Uncle Jeff, Cousin Justin, and
Tyler the dog were there too. Justin doesn't walk yet, but he is still
fun to play with. Tyler is a funny doggy who makes Shane laugh, but he
is so big that he can be a little intimidating too. There are so many
exciting things to do at Grandma and Grandpa's house that Shane
doesn't want to take a nap -- sometimes he gets tired and cranky and
wants to cling to mom ("I want the momma!" he says). He still likes it
when mom carries him around in the sling.

<p>Shane likes to sit at his own little table. The glass table in the
living room is also fun to bang on -- especially when you have a 
balloon. The living room is a good place to watch all of the cool
trucks at the house they are building next door. Shane can now say
truck, ballon, jar
and hot.</p>

<p>Shane got his second hair cut. He likes to play with Dad's hat (and
he likes to say "hat" too). He also likes to read his books.</p>
