<h3>Shane's Thirty-ninth Week</h3>

<p>
Shane went to New York City with Mom and Dad. The lights in Times
Square were very cool! Shane was so excited he said "bah! bah! bah!
bah!" The weather was very warm for January, and Shane and Dad had a
nice walk in Central Park while Mom attended an ACM Publications Board
meeting.
