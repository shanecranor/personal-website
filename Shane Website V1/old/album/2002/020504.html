<h3>One Year</h3>

<p>All of Shane's grandparents and some of his great grandparents came
to visit for his first birthday. Shane got lots of nice
presents. Grandma Connie baked Shane a cake, which he enjoyed quite a
bit. Dad turned Shane's car seat around so he can face forward now and
better enjoy the ride in Mom and Dad's new car.</p>

Mom and Dad got tired of people confusing Shane for a little girl, so
they took him for his first hair cut. Now he looks like a little boy
again.

<p>Shane likes to go out to eat at restaurants that have
balloons. He also likes to eat rice and black beans at Mexican restaurants.
Mom and Dad bought Shane some shoes -- size 4 1/2 wide.  Shane
likes his new shoes.  Shane likes to walk pushing his cart or holding
somebody's hand. Sometimes he walks a few steps on his own. Walking
outside is especially fun.

<p>
Shane likes to say "the car, the car, the car!" He also likes to ride
in the car. He goes to the front door and says "Mama, go go bye bye!"
when he wants to go outside. He has started walking more, and he likes
to stop and play in the dirt and pick up sticks. Some of Shane's other
new words include: Night night, PJs, nose, tree, bird, doggy, cup,
book, ball, and shoes. He tries
to say banana too.
