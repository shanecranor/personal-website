<p>Shane got dressed up in his spiffy clothes (courtesy of Auntie
Amber) to attend his first wedding. Milind finally stopped dilly
dallying around and tied the knot with Aparna! Zubin flew in from
California for the big event. On the way home from the wedding Zubin
and Shane went night night.</p>

<p>The leaves are starting to fall and Shane is very excited to see so
many leaves on the ground. He is helping Mom and Dad clean them up,
one leaf at a time. Shane likes to be helpful. Besides picking up
leaves, he can put things in the garbage and "help" put away the clean
laundry. Shane can say his first name now and count to 10. He can also
say "E" as in Yvonne. He has lots of new words: phone, garbage, up,
crayon, purple, green, red, plate, fork, juice, pumpkin, pasta, pizza,
diaper, wipes, butt, peel (as in banana), flakes (as in corn flakes),
clothes, tie (as in shoe), belt, pants, shirt, undies, bra, boat,
cracker, bounce, paper, mail, pest, and OK ("kay"), and there you
go. He knows that doggies say woof woof, cats say meow, duckies say
quack quack, birdies say tweet tweet, cars say beep beep, fishies say
blub blub, and monkeys say ee-eee. He know that E comes on the choo
choo, and he recognizes the sound of the choo choo when he hears
it. And he likes to sing E-I-E-I-O. Shane had lots of visitors over
the past few weeks. It is getting too cold outside for sandles, so
Shane got some new shoes.</p>

<p>Shane got a new winter coat. It is blue and orange -- like his 
pumpkin. Shane thinks pumpkins are pretty neat. He was very excited to
watch Mom and Dad turn his pumpkin into a jack-o-lantern. Shane
dressed up as a doggy for Halloween. He learned to say "tail," "candy," and
"ghost." What do ghosts say? "Boo" of course!
