<h3>Shane's Thirty-sixth Week</h3>

<p>On January 5, we had the first real snow fall of the winter in New
Jersey. Shane already saw some snow in Denver, but this snow was still
very interesting to watch.</p>

<h3>Shane's Thirty-seventh Week</h3>
<p>Shane flew to North Carolina with Mom and Dad so that Dad could
attend a program committee meeting. Shane got to see Uncle Jeremy's
lab at the University of North Carolina. And he met Mom and Dad's
friend Sarang and the Presler-Marshall family. Shane practiced
pushing his stroller around the hotel in North Carolina, so when he
got home Mom and Dad bought him a walker toy. He likes to push it
around the family room, but he doesn't put his feet flat on the floor
so he pushes it on his knees mostly.</p>

<h3>Shane's Thirty-eigth Week</h3> 

<p>Shane has been very busy playing with all his toys. He is learning
how to pick up Joe's O's and put them in his mouth and eat them. Great
Grandma Gertie made Shane a snazzy new sweater -- there's lots of room 
for Shane to grow into it. It
snowed again this week, and Shane went outside with Mom and helped her
build a snowman. Shane has been enjoying playing with Mom and Dad's
friend Paul, who is staying with us until he moves to Chicago. Shane
also tried blueberries this week -- his first blue/purple food.
