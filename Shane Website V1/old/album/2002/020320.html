<h3>Shane's Forty-seventh Week</h3>

<p>Shane has gotten very good at steering his cart. He can go in
circles and do u-turns. He can push it with one hand. But he can stand
for only a few seconds without holding onto something.</p>

<h3>Shane's Forty-ninth Week</h3>

<p> Shane attended Mom's Chatham Community Band Concert, but he was so
bored he fell asleep. The next day Shane helped Dad change a lightbulb
-- climbing a ladder couldn't be that much more difficult than
climbing a flight of steps!
