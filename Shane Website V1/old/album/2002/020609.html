Shane went to New York City with Mom and Dad. It was very exciting!
Then when Shane got home Grandma Connie and Grandpa Morris stopped by
on their way to the airport. Some of Shane's new words include: bread,
cheese, door, keys, stick, dirt, and flower. Shane still likes to say "baby"
especially when he eats YoBaby yogurt. He also says "bye bye" when he
sees the telephone.

<p>Shane likes to play with balls. He also likes to point at balls and
talk about balls. Puddles and sticks and dirt are fun to play with
too. Shane got a new hat with a chin strap to make it difficult to
take off.</p>

<p>Shane took the train to Maryland with Mom and Dad. He had lots of fun with
Grandma Judy and Grandpa Mike while Mom went to a conference. He went
to their offices and he got to play with Grandpa Mike's trains. He
also got to see Uncle Jeremy and Aunt Amber and Robroy the greyhound. After
Mom's conference was over Shane and Mom and Dad went to visit Aunt
Ginny and Uncle Jeff and cousin Justin. Justin likes balls too. Before
going home, Shane visited lots of monuments in Washington, DC with Mom
and Dad.</p>

Shane went to some picnics with Mom and Dad. He got to play with Mom's
boss's kids and also hit Dad's boss on the head. He also got to watch
the Randolph fireworks, which were very cool (last year he slept
through them). Shane learned how to say "Ollie" (the name of one of
Dad's friends), socks, spoon, bursh, comb, potty, socks, tummy, eye,
ear, bubbles,
bottle, bath, bag, cat, monkey, and berry.

Mom and Dad bought a backpack that Shane can ride in. Shane gets a
good view from up there. Shane likes to collect the dish towels in the
kitchen. Sometimes he puts them in his cart and pushes them around --
some times he just waves them in the air. He also likes to pick up the
milk and juice containers (and any other garbage he can get out of the
recycle bin). He can also say milk and juice, as well as choo choo (as
in train).
