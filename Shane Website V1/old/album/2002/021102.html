<h3>18-19 Months</h3>

<p>Shane stayed at the new Westin hotel in New York with Mom and
Dad. Shane liked the window seat and the view. Shane also liked the
elevator ("elbababer") -- that's a big word to say!  New York is a very
interesting, and Shane was so excited he did not want to go night
night. When Shane got home the next day he did some puzzles with Dad.</p>

</p>

<p>Shane loves to play in the leaves. He helped Dad rake the leaves,
and he learned to say rake and leaf blower. He is putting more words
together into sentences now. When he can't find something he asks! For
example, when he wants to know where the moon is he says
"Where the moon go?" He also knows that the moon is in the sky, but
sometimes the moon goes night night. He also asks to have things
opened -- jars, yogurt containers, envelopes, straw wrappers, even bananas ("open 
mana")... sometimes he even says please. And he likes to close
containers too ("lid on"). Shane really likes lights. He
likes to say "light on." He also knows about red lights and green
lights. If you ask him how he is he will tell you that he is "fine." 
Other new words he likes to say are clock, cracker, tofu,  up ("up,
up, up"), 
down ("I want doowwn"), fire truck, hippopotamus, help, lap, fabric,
Elmo, Mickey, tea, piggy, and cow. Shane also likes to sing. He can take any word you suggest to
him and repeat it over and over again in a song.

<p>Shane went with Mom and Dad to Aunt Bonnie and Uncle Fred's house
for Thanksgiving dinner. Shane didn't eat any turkey but he ate lots
of crackers. The next day Shane kept saying "Uncle Fred!" This year
Chanukah started the night after Thanksgiving. Shane likes to unwrap
his presents. Lighting the candles and playing with dreidles is lots
of fun. Shane says "dreidle spin" and "candle light." Shane also says
"red light" and "green light" when he is in the car.</p>

<p>This week was very exciting. Shane went to mom and dad's office and played with some other kids
whose parents brought them to work. Shane says "office" and "kids."
The next day Shane went to the Big Apple Circus with mom and dad and
Yvonne and her grandson. The circus was very exciting, and riding on
the train and the subway to get there was fun too. The day after that
we got an early snow storm and dad had to put the snow plow on the
tractor to clear the driveway. But the snow did not delay the
construction on our basement, which is still ahead of schedule.</p>

<p>Shane likes to play with his trucks and hide. He is saying more
phrases and sentences: "Shane
hiding," "drinking the water," "I want flakes in the green bowl," "I
want to go go green car," "I want green light," "up mama," "up dada,"
"up bed," "down Shane," "boy chair" (in
reference to a "big boy chair" as opposed to a high chair), and "no
nooo apple" (or toast, or Os, or whatever it is he wants to make very
clear that he doesn't want). This week Shane got to have lunch with
Ann and Paul who were visiting from Chicago. </p>

<p>After Christmas, Shane went to visit Grandma Judy and Papa
  Mike. Auntie Amber and Uncle Jere and Robroy doggie and Marie the cat were there
  too. Shane likes Papa Mike's choo choos. Robroy doggie and the
  kitty cat made a big impression on him too. Shane also got to visit
  the National Zoo. He saw the camels and the elephants and the
  giraffes and the monkeys. When Shane got home he watched Dad try out
  his Christmas present -- a carpet cleaner.</p>
