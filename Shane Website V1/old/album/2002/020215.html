<h3>Shande's Forty-third Week</h3>

<p>
Shane got to see both his Grandmas and also Grandpa Mike this week. He
learned to climb into his activity table. He's very busy, but he still
takes time out for a nap sometimes. And when he fell asleep one day
mom and dad snapped a picture of his new teeth.

<h3>Shane's Forty-Forth Week</h3>
<p>
Pushing the stool around the kitchen is lots of fun. So is climbing up
and down the stairs. Shane insists on going down head first. Sometimes
this works out ok and sometimes it doesn't.

<h3>Shane's Forty-Fifth Week</h3>

<p>Shane went to the Morristown St. Patrick's Day Parade with Mom and
Dad. He liked watching all the bands march by. Shane has gotten very
good at drinking from his sippy cup.</p>
