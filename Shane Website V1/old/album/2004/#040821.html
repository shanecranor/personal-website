<h3>Shane at 36 to 38 months</h3>

<p>Grandma Connie and Grandpa Morris came to visit for Shane's third
birthday. Shane got lots of choo choos, including the battery powered
"James" he so desperately wanted. Mom baked chocolate banana cupcakes
and brought them to school on Shane's birthday. Bekah and Maya came to
school too. </P>

<p>Shane went to North Carolina to attend Uncle Jere's medical school
graduation. He got to see lots of grandmas and grandpas, and eat at
fancy restaurants, and meet his Cousin Benny.</p>

<p>Shane had his last day of school. He is disappointed that he won't
get to see Franny any more. A few weeks before the end of the year
they took a nice class photo. Shane actually sat still and smiled for
his school portrait.</p>

<p>Shane went to the Pittsburgh Zoo with Mom and Dad and Maya. He said
he liked the fishies the best (the Pittsburgh Zoo has an aquarium). He
also had a good time climbing the "spider web." Shane is starting to
really like playing with Maya. Of course, he thinks he should have all
the toys. But he likes making Maya laugh and he let's her pull his
hair.</p>

<p>Shane likes to play outside with Davis and Cole. He also likes to
play with Maya. "Let's make a sandwhich," says Shane. "I want to be
the peanut butter and Maya can be the jelly." Yvonne came to visit
Maya and Shane.</p>

<p>Shane's house is getting a new heating and air conditioning system. Shane likes to inspect the work done each day after "the mans" leave.</p>

<p>Shane went to Maryland to visit lots of relatives. He met baby
cousin Eric and had a great time playing with Cousin Justin. He didn't
like seeing cicadas ("kaydas") everywhere, however.</p>

<p>Shane's friend Mira came for a visit on her way to Ann Arbor. They
had a great time.</p>

<p>Shane went to visit Grandma Connie and Papa Morris. He stayed at
their house for a few days while Mom and Dad and Maya went to New
Jersey. For some unknown reason he said "crocodile" over and over again
very loudly in the car on the way there.</p>

<p>Shane has lots of battery powered trains now. Percy is the latest addition to his collection.</p>

<p>The Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix was a big event in the park down
the street from our house. Shane had a great time looking at all the
vintage and not-so-vintage cars. Mom and Dad finally got around to
putting the climber together in the backyard. Shane and Maya had lots
of fun climbing on it. So did Davis and Cole. They invited Shane over
for yogurt pops.</P>

<p>Shane had a good time playing in the Chicken Soup with Rice at the Pittsburgh Children's Museum. He also liked the bird cage once he figured out how to get down (good thing Davis was there to show him how).</p>
