<h3>33-35 Months</h3>

<p>We were all sad to see Yvonne leave us at the end of January. Shane
says he misses her, but he also likes his new nanny, Bekah. The
weather has been very cold this winter, and we had only 3 days in
January that did not rain or snow. So Shane hasn't been able to go
outside and run around very much. Mom and Dad have been taking him to
CMU to run around inside instead. Shane also likes to draw on the
white board in Mom's office. In the middle of February Shane got a
haircut at Supercuts, his first haircut that wasn't at a kids "haircut
house."</p>

<p>Shane went to St. Louis with Mom, Dad, and Maya. He had a good time
going to all of Mom and Dad's favorite restaurants -- Mai Lee,
Blueberry Hill, Casa Gailardo Grill, and the St. Louis Bread
Company. He met Brad and Penny and Braydon. He checked out the
Washington University campus and had a good time playing on the
playground in Shaw Park.</p>

<p>Shane likes the fact that our new house has two staircases -- a
purple staircase and a green staircase. Shane likes to make Maya laugh. Sometimes he lets her play with his toys, but he is very possessive of his trains.</p>

<p>Aunt Ginny, Uncle Jeff, and Cousin Justin came to visit. Shane
showed Justin how to color on Dad's white board at work. The weather
was really nice and everyone got to play outside. We blew lots of
bubbles and even got to eat lunch outside.</p>

<p>Shane went to the CMU Carnival. He liked getting ballons and he
really enjoyed going on the rides. It was fun walking over the hill to
see the buggy races.</p>
