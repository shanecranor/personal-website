<p>All of Shane's grandmas and grandpas came to visit for Maya's
birthday. Shane helped Mom bake banana birthday cupcakes (with
sprinkles on top). Shane had a good time helping Maya blow out her
candles and open her presents. He especially liked helping her play
with her toys.</p>

<p>It's getting cooler outside so Mom brought Shane's little coleus
plant inside. She cut off some of the leaves and put them in water to
grow roots. After some roots grew, Shane planted the little plants in
pots and put them on the kitchen window sill. Shane watched Dad mow
the yard for the last time this year and put the snow blade on the
lawn tractor.</p>

<p>Shane went to see Dr. Jack the dentist. He liked getting his teeth
brushed. He has been waiting for the leaves to fall down since the
beginning of fall. He had a good time raking the leaves.Shane decided
he wanted to be an alligator for Halloween. He wore his costume to the
SCS Halloween party and he went trick-or-treating with Davis and
Cole.</p> <p>
